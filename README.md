# barefootr

An R package for things I have written that I find useful. No guarantees of quality, completeness, or documentation. Oftentimes just a tool that I want to be able to access over and over again.

Please let me know if you use it. It's all pretty inefficient, but maybe you'll find a use for something.

## Install

For easy install, just open up your favorite terminal emulator, and start `R` first get `devtools` from CRAN. This package was written by Hadley Wickham. It's very good.
```r
install.packages('devtools')
```
Next, load the package.
```r
library(devtools)
```
Now you can install directly from *anyone's* github account. For this one, you would next enter:
```r
install_github('ericbarefoot/barefootr')
```
And that's it! This package will now be in your `installed packages` library, and you can call it with `library` just like any other package. To check for updates or new documentation just install again, and you'll get the newest stuff.
